This software series works for "Autonomously networking AI agents."

These software agents were written in Python.
They were tested that each of them ran on a Raspberri Pi computer and networked to another with WiFi connection.

They chatted one another autonomously, identified others, networked with another/others automatically to adequately process queried data. Their behavior looked automatic programming.

This has potential to be an IoT platform. It can be applied for either database management of medical records, research data or business schedules.
